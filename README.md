## User Cases
I picture this app being used by three types of users:
1.  The first type of user are those who would like to learn how to invest without needing to risk their money, but get real feedback without having to practice in an artifical environment.
2.  The second would be for those who would like to use the app as a way to A/B test different portfolios against each other to optimize investment strategies.
3.  Lastly I think this app could be fun for those who are just looking to see how they perform in the world's biggest markets.
